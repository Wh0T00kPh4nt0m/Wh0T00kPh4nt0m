Absolutely. Think of this as a **field kit** rather than magic spells: sensible defaults, realistic flags, and commands you’d actually type during a CPTS-style engagement. I’ll keep it practical and opinionated.

### Network / Host Discovery

**Basic ICMP sweep (fast, polite, often blocked):**

```bash
nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24
```

This sends ping-style probes only. No ports, no drama.

**Skip ping checks (for grumpy firewalls):**

```bash
nmap -Pn 10.10.10.50
```

Assumes the host is up and goes straight to probing. Slower, but effective when ICMP is filtered.

**Discover live hosts + top ports (early signal):**

```bash
nmap -Pn --top-ports 100 10.10.10.0/24
```

Good balance between speed and usefulness.

### Masscan (When You Want Speed and Don’t Care About Subtlety)

**Fast discovery of common ports:**

```bash
masscan 10.10.10.0/24 -p80,443,22,3389 --rate 5000
```

Masscan is a chainsaw, not a scalpel. Use responsibly.

**Full TCP scan (loud, but revealing):**

```bash
masscan 10.10.10.0/24 -p1-65535 --rate 10000
```

Follow up anything interesting with nmap for accuracy.

---

### arp-scan (Internal Networks Only)

**Discover devices on your local subnet:**

```bash
sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24
```

Layer-2 magic. Bypasses firewalls entirely because ARP doesn’t ask permission.

**Aggressive scan of all interfaces:**

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet
```

---

### DNS Recon

**Basic DNS queries:**

```bash
dig example.com
dig A example.com
dig MX example.com
```

**Attempt a zone transfer (rare, but glorious when it works):**

```bash
dig AXFR example.com @ns1.example.com
```

**nslookup quick checks:**

```bash
nslookup example.com
nslookup -type=TXT example.com
```

---

### dnsenum

**Full enumeration with brute forcing:**

```bash
dnsenum example.com
```

**Specify a wordlist and DNS server:**

```bash
dnsenum example.com -f /usr/share/wordlists/dns.txt -r
```

---

### dnsrecon

**Standard enumeration:**

```bash
dnsrecon -d example.com
```

**Brute-force subdomains:**

```bash
dnsrecon -d example.com -D /usr/share/wordlists/dns.txt -t brt
```

---

### Web Content Discovery

**ffuf (fast and flexible):**

```bash
ffuf -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

**Fuzz subdomains:**

```bash
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w subdomains.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com"
```

---

**gobuster (solid classic):**

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

**Subdomain mode:**

```bash
gobuster dns -d example.com -w subdomains.txt
```

---

**feroxbuster (recursive, opinionated, excellent):**

```bash
feroxbuster -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

**Add recursion + extensions:**

```bash
feroxbuster -u https://example.com -x php,txt,html -r
```

---

### Web Tech Fingerprinting

**whatweb (CLI-friendly):**

```bash
whatweb https://example.com
```

**Aggressive mode:**

```bash
whatweb -a 3 https://example.com
```

---

**wappalyzer (CLI via node):**

```bash
wappalyzer https://example.com
```

Best paired with Burp or browser extension during manual testing.

### Mental Model to Keep You Sharp

Recon isn’t about running *everything*. It’s about **forming hypotheses**:
“This looks like IIS → maybe legacy ASP.”
“This DNS setup smells like a dev subdomain.”
“This web server is quiet… suspiciously quiet.”
