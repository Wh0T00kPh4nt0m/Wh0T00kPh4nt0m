Absolutely. Think of this less like a checklist and more like a **mental map** you can walk through calmly when the clock is ticking and your brain is trying to betray you. Methodology is how you stop flailing and start *hunting*.

What follows is a **clean, systematic penetration-testing methodology**, structured so you can apply it during CPTS/CTPS-style labs without overthinking. This mirrors how real operators think, not how marketing slides pretend they do.

## 0. Pre-Engagement Mindset (The Invisible Step)

Before touching tools, lock this in:

You are always asking three questions:

1. *What is exposed?*
2. *What does it trust?*
3. *What does it let me become?*

Everything below is just different ways of answering those.

---

## 1. Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

### External Recon (No Access Yet)

Goal: **Build an attack surface map**

You are collecting *facts*, not exploiting yet.

**Network-level**

* IP ranges, live hosts
* Open ports
* Service versions
* TLS, banners, headers

**DNS / Web-facing**

* Subdomains
* Virtual hosts
* Tech stack fingerprints
* Auth portals, APIs, admin panels

**Human / Logical**

* Usernames, email formats
* Password policies (if visible)
* Error messages leaking info

Mental note:

> If you don’t know *what exists*, you can’t know *what’s vulnerable*.

---

### Internal Recon (After Foothold)

Goal: **Understand the environment you’re inside**

* Network segments
* Domain membership
* Trust relationships
* Naming conventions (these matter more than people admit)
* Where users log in vs where servers live

This is where calm beats speed.

---

## 2. Scanning & Enumeration (The Real Work)

Scanning finds doors. Enumeration figures out **which ones aren’t locked properly**.

### Service Enumeration (Infrastructure)

You’re asking:

* What service?
* What version?
* What misconfiguration?
* What authentication?

Common targets:

* SMB
* FTP
* SSH
* RDP
* WinRM
* SNMP
* LDAP
* Databases

Notes:

* Anonymous access?
* Weak creds?
* Default configs?
* Read vs write access?

If a service responds differently to bad input, it’s *talking to you*. Listen.

---

### Web Application Enumeration

Different mindset.

You’re not attacking the server — you’re attacking **logic**.

Look for:

* Auth flows
* Role separation failures
* File uploads
* APIs
* Session handling
* Input handling

Mental shift:

> Infrastructure breaks with math. Web apps break with assumptions.

---

### Active Directory Enumeration (If Domain-Joined)

AD is not “another service”. It’s **the map of power**.

You’re mapping:

* Users
* Groups
* Computers
* Privileges
* Trust paths

Key questions:

* Who can log in where?
* Who can reset whose password?
* Who runs what services?
* What runs as SYSTEM or DA?

BloodHound isn’t magic. It just visualises **human mistakes** at scale.

---

## 3. Initial Access (The First Crack)

Goal: **Execute code or authenticate as someone**

Typical routes:

* Valid credentials
* Service misconfiguration
* Web app → OS execution
* File upload → shell
* Deserialization, command injection, etc.

Important rule:

> Access without stability is useless.

Once in:

* Get a stable shell
* Understand *who you are*
* Understand *where you are*

---

## 4. Post-Exploitation Enumeration (Now You’re Dangerous)

This phase is criminally rushed by beginners.

You check:

* User privileges
* Group membership
* Tokens
* Scheduled tasks
* Services running as higher users
* Stored credentials
* Network visibility

You are no longer hacking.
You are **auditing trust boundaries from the inside**.

---

## 5. Privilege Escalation

Goal: **Become more than you are**

### Local Privilege Escalation

* Weak file permissions
* Services running as SYSTEM
* Unquoted paths
* Kernel exploits (last resort)
* Credential reuse

### Domain Privilege Escalation (AD)

* Kerberoasting
* AS-REP roasting
* Delegation abuse
* ACL abuse
* GPO misconfigs
* Service accounts with sins

Rule:

> If escalation feels brute-forcey, you’re probably missing something obvious.

---

## 6. Lateral Movement

Goal: **Expand control**

You are asking:

* Where else do these creds work?
* Who logs into multiple machines?
* What servers trust this account?

Methods:

* SMB / WinRM / RDP
* SSH
* Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket
* Service account reuse

Movement should feel *inevitable*, not frantic.

---

## 7. Persistence (Think Like a Defender)

Even if the exam doesn’t focus heavily here, the mindset matters.

Examples:

* New users
* Scheduled tasks
* Startup scripts
* GPO changes
* Backdoored services

This teaches you **where defenders fail**.

---

## 8. Impact / Objectives

Goal: **Prove compromise**

This might be:

* Domain Admin
* Sensitive file access
* Database dump
* Flags
* Business logic abuse

Impact answers the only question that matters:

> “So what?”

---

## 9. Reporting Mindset (Even in Labs)

After every box, ask:

* What was the entry point?
* Why did it work?
* What would have stopped it?

This locks knowledge into long-term memory and makes you faster next time.

---

## Mental Cheat Code for CPTS / CTPS

When stuck, cycle this loop:

**Enumerate → Hypothesise → Test → Observe → Adjust**

Never:

* Run tools blindly
* Chase exploits without context
* Assume difficulty means complexity

Real systems fail in *boring, repeatable ways*.

---

### Final Mentor Note

You’re doing the right thing. People fail these exams not because they lack tools, but because their thinking becomes nonlinear under pressure. A methodology is cognitive scaffolding — it keeps you upright when fatigue sets in.

Next evolution, when you’re ready:

* Turn this into a **one-page flowchart**
* Then compress it into a **mental script**

At that point, you’re no longer “doing labs”.
You’re *operating*.
