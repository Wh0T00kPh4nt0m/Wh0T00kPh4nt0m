Post‑exploitation enumeration is where you stop celebrating the shell and start **listening to the machine**. Every system confesses eventually. Your job is to ask better questions, in the right order, without tripping over your own excitement.

Let’s do Linux first, then Windows. Same pattern in both worlds: *who am I → what can I run → what’s running → what’s misconfigured → what’s forgotten*.

## Linux Post‑Exploitation Enumeration

### Identity & Context (always first)

```bash
id
```

```bash
groups
```

These tell you who you are **and who you’re allowed to pretend to be**.

---

### Sudo Rights (high‑value check)

```bash
sudo -l
```

Read this slowly. If you skim it, you’ll miss the exploit that was basically gift‑wrapped.

Common red flags:

* Commands without passwords
* Wildcards
* Editors (`vi`, `less`, `awk`, `find`)
* Custom scripts in writable locations

---

### Processes & Services

```bash
ps aux
```

Look for:

* root‑owned processes running from odd paths
* credentials in command arguments
* cron jobs hiding in plain sight

```bash
ss -tuln
```

This shows listening services. Internal ports often mean internal trust.

---

### SUID Binaries (classic, still deadly)

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Anything unusual here earns a trip to GTFOBins. SUID + creativity = promotion.

---

### linPEAS (Speedrun Mode)

```bash
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh
```

If you’re short on time:

```bash
./linpeas.sh -a
```

linPEAS doesn’t replace thinking. It accelerates it. Treat yellow and red output as **hypotheses**, not conclusions.

---

## Windows Post‑Exploitation Enumeration

Windows is louder than Linux. It overshares.

---

### Identity & Privileges

```powershell
whoami /all
```

This is critical. You’re not just a user — you’re a **set of privileges**. SeImpersonatePrivilege is the quiet celebrity here.

---

### Users & Groups

```cmd
net user
```

```cmd
net localgroup
```

```cmd
net localgroup administrators
```

Check who *shouldn’t* be there. They’re usually the reason you’re there.

---

### Running Processes (with context)

```cmd
tasklist /v
```

Look for:

* services running as SYSTEM
* odd parent/child relationships
* credentials in window titles (yes, it still happens)

---

### Services (misconfigurations live here)

```cmd
sc qc servicename
```

You’re hunting for:

* unquoted service paths
* writable binaries
* services running as SYSTEM

Pair this with:

```cmd
icacls "C:\Path\To\Service.exe"
```

If users can write to it, you’re holding the keys.

---

### winPEAS (Windows Confessional)

```powershell
.\winPEAS.exe
```

Quieter run:

```powershell
.\winPEAS.exe quiet
```

You’re looking for:

* credential leftovers
* registry secrets
* service misconfigs
* privilege escalation vectors

winPEAS is noisy but honest. Filter ruthlessly.

## The Pattern (This Is the Skill)

Post‑exploitation enumeration follows a rhythm:

1. Who am I?
2. What am I allowed to do?
3. What’s running that trusts me?
4. What trusts *too much*?
5. What did the admin forget?

Tools answer questions.
Experience decides **which questions are worth asking**.

From here, the gravity well pulls you toward **privilege escalation**: abusing sudo, tokens, services, cron jobs, capabilities, delegation mistakes. This is where operators separate from tool‑runners, and where systems finally admit what they were afraid of all along.
