7. Persistence (Optional, Context‑Driven)

Persistence is not about malice. It’s about demonstrating impact.

Scheduled Tasks
schtasks /query


Conceptually: tasks run as SYSTEM, on schedule, without supervision.

New Users
net user audit_admin Password123! /add
net localgroup administrators audit_admin /add


Simple. Loud. Effective.

Service Modification

Services run forever. That’s the problem.

GPO Abuse (Advanced AD)

If you can modify a GPO linked to many machines, you don’t need lateral movement anymore. The domain moves for you.

The Final Truth (This Is the Lesson)

Most environments don’t fall because of exploits.
They fall because trust accumulates silently.

Privilege escalation is noticing excess.
Lateral movement is following habit.
Persistence is proving risk.
